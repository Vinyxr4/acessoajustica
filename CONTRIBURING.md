# Contributing to ToPS

### Team members

This project was originally developed as part of the eXtreme Programming course of 2015 at University of SÃ£o Paulo.

To know the main contributors of this project check [CONTRIBUTORS](https://github.com/acessoajustica/acessoajustica/blob/master/CONTRIBUTORS).

### Adding new features

* Check out the latest master to make sure the feature hasn't been implemented or the bug hasn't been fixed yet.
* Open an [issue](https://github.com/acessoajustica/acessoajustica/issues) with your proposal, to see if somebody else has done it.
* Check out the [issue tracker](https://github.com/acessoajustica/acessoajustica/issues) to make sure someone already hasn't requested it and/or contributed it.
* Fork the project.
* Start a feature/bugfix branch.
* Commit and push until you are happy with your contribution.
* Make sure to add tests for the feature/bugfix. This is important so I don't break it in a future version unintentionally.
* Please try not to mess with the Gemfile, version, or history. If you want to have your own version, or is otherwise necessary, that is fine, but please isolate it to its own commit so I can cherry-pick around it.

### Bug triage

* You can help report bugs by opening an [issue](https://github.com/acessoajustica/acessoajustica/issues) and labeling it as a `bug`.
* You can look through the existing bugs [here](https://github.com/acessoajustica/acessoajustica/issues?q=is%3Aopen+is%3Aissue+label%3Abug).
* Look at existing bugs and help us understand:
  * Is the bug reproducible? 
  * Is it reproducible in other OS? 
  * What are the steps to reproduce?
